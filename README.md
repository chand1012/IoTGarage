# IoTGarage

This is my project for connecting various devices in my home to a self hosted and homemade IoT server that is also Alexa Enabled. The `flaskRouter` directory runs on a Raspberry Pi, the `alexa` directory runs on an AWS Lambda function, and the `devices` directory is the code for all of the devices that I connect to the network, all of which so far have been [NodeMCU](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IK9GEQG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)s programmed with the Arduino IDE.
